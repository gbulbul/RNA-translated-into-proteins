There are 20 aminoacids, each is made up of 3 RNA nts which is called codon. An aminoacid is represented by at least one codon, which means two different codons may indicate the same aa. Here, this program produces a protein which is an aa chain. For a given RNA string, this program manages to obtain the corresponding protein by matching all triples to aacids.
